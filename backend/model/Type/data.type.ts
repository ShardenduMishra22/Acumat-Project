/*
  So basically there are two types of documents 
  Images and Reports
  Reports can be docs or Pdf and will be made By Doctor/Hospital himself,reports are filan verdict of the doctor.
  Images will be uploaded by Hospital on behalf of Patient,Images can have annotations, Images are completely optional.

/*
  Should Case Contain report Id? That’s a solid observation. It really comes down to your app’s query patterns. Keeping documents and reports in their own collections and referencing the case with a caseId is a classic normalized approach, making them independent and easier to manage. However, if you’re often fetching a case along with its related documents and reports, embedding their IDs directly in the case document as arrays can speed up lookups. It's all about weighing the trade-offs between normalization (flexibility and smaller document sizes) and denormalization (query performance and convenience).
